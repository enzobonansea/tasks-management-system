# Tasks management system

The main goal of this little project is to demonstrate my knowledge in DDD, TDD, Event-Driven Architecture, OOP, .NET, and Docker.

The first feature that I will develop is the creation of a Task, a simple entity that has only Title, Description, and Date. When the date arrives, some consequences should occur, for example sending a notification; for now, I will only dispatch the event. Later, I will add some handlers for that event.
